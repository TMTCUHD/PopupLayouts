# PopupLayouts
Xamarin Forms Responsive Popup Layouts One of the biggest challengers with Xamarin Forms is displaying the kind of popups users expect in IOS apps.  Xlabâ€™s PopupLayout.cs gets you on your way but is limited.  This Popup Layouts sample application demonstrates what you can achieve using just Xamarin code.  As with most complex forms layouts, the biggest challenge is responding to orientation changes.   This popup class takes care of all that for you.  It even responds to relative popups within a Scroll View.  The popup arrow will stay relative to the control that launched it.  It will also adjust and reposition itself relative to its position within a scroll.  The main methods are ShowPopupRelative, ShowPopupByMargin and ShowPopupCenter.  Since it is a class you can easily tweak the display to your specific requirements.  It also works on Android.
